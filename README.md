## What is it
* Interface to show questions and answer for a quiz show.
* Ability to play sound effects by manually pushing buttons on the keyboard

## Getting started
* It is a website. A Visual Studio project has been used to edit files, but it is not necessary for either compiling nor using the project
* Uses [gruntjs.com](grunt) for building and bundling less and javascript. So in the src/website folder you should restore node packages and execute grunt
